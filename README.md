# Election_Analysis


## Project Overview
- I was asked to perform an election audit to assit Tom, a Colorado board of elections committee employee.
- The election audit is for a US Congressional precinct in Colorado.
- The original task was to report the following: 
1.  Total number of votes cast
2.  Complete list of all candidates
3. Total number of votes for each candidate
4. Percentage of votes for each candidate
5. Winner of the election based on popular vote
- Additionally, I reported the following along with the election audit:
