# Election_Analysis


## Project Overview
- I was asked to perform an election audit to assit Tom, a Colorado board of elections committee employee.
- The election audit is for a US Congressional precinct in Colorado.
- The original task was to report the following: 
1.  Total number of votes cast
2.  Complete list of all candidates
3. Total number of votes for each candidate
4. Percentage of votes for each candidate
5. Winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.68.1
- MSU Bootcamp Spot Module 3: https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2508/modules

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that: 
- 369,711 total votes were cast
- Three different counties participated in this election:
    - Jefferson County, which had 10.5% of the vote, with a total of 38,855 votes.
    - Denver County, which had 82.8% of the vote, with a total of 306,055 votes.
    - Arapahoe County, which had 6.7% of the vote, with a total of 24,801 votes.
- Based on the results, Denver county had the largest number of votes from its citizens.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockholm
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
 - The results were: 
    - Charles Casper Stockholm received 23.0% of the vote with 85,213 votes. 
    - Diana GeGette received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes.
 - Based on the results, the winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Summary

- By executing the election audit using Python, it is possible to now run this same program for any election. 
- Some modifications to the code are necessary. For example, the file that is being loaded into the Python script to run the analysis on needs to be updated to show the file for the specific election. 
- The location of the new CSV files need to be updated, and the location of the text file where the results are being saved to will also need to be changed.
